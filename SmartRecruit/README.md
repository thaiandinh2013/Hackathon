About The Smart Recruits

The Smart Recruits is a data science & machine learning competition hosted by analyticsvidhya.com. Basically, based on the profile of the job applicants, we will try to predict whether these applicants would meet the targets assigned to them if they were selected for the jobs.

ROC will be used to measure the accuracy of the model. 

The technique that I used to build is gradient boosting.
